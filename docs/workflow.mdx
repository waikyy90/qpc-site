## Workflow overview

Each project is discussed and tailored to ensure technical feasibility, appropriate experimental design, and biologically meaningful outcomes.

---

<div className="qpc-workflow-step">
### 1. Consultation and study planning

Projects begin with discussion to clarify the biological question, sample type, and experimental constraints. Study design considerations — including controls, replication, and quantitative strategy — are reviewed prior to experimental work.
</div>

---

<div className="qpc-workflow-step">
### 2. Sample preparation and experimental execution

Samples are processed using established and optimised workflows appropriate for the study design. Depending on the application, this may include enrichment strategies, fractionation, and high-resolution mass spectrometry.
</div>

---

<div className="qpc-workflow-step">
### 3. Data processing and quality control

Raw mass spectrometry data are processed using validated analysis pipelines. Quality control is performed at multiple stages to assess data completeness, reproducibility, and quantitative performance.
</div>

---

<div className="qpc-workflow-step">
### 4. Data analysis and interpretation

Processed data are analysed and visualised in the context of the original biological question. Results are interpreted internally prior to discussion with collaborators.
</div>

---

<div className="qpc-workflow-step">
### 5. Data delivery and follow-up

Processed datasets, analysis outputs, and visualised results are shared with collaborators. Follow-up discussions may be arranged to clarify findings or plan subsequent experiments.
