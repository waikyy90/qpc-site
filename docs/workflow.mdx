# How We Support Quantitative Proteomics Projects
<br />

This page outlines the typical stages of a quantitative proteomics project at the Quantitative Proteomics Core, from initial consultation through data interpretation. The workflow highlights key touchpoints across study planning, experimental execution, data processing, and downstream analysis.

**Consultation & study planning**

Each project begins with a discussion to clarify the biological question, sample type, and experimental constraints. Study design, controls, replicates, and quantitative strategies are reviewed together to ensure feasibility and robustness before experiments begin.

**Sample preparation & experimental execution**

Samples are processed using established and optimized workflows appropriate for the study design. Depending on the application, this may include enrichment strategies, fractionation, label-free approaches, and high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis.

**Data processing & quality control**

Raw mass spectrometry data are processed using validated analysis pipelines. Quality control is performed at multiple stages to assess data completeness, reproducibility, and quantitative performance.

**Data analysis & interpretation**

We support downstream data analysis through statistical evaluation, visualization, and biological contextualization. Results are discussed with collaborators to ensure findings are interpretable, relevant, and suitable for publication or follow-up studies.

**Data delivery & follow-up**

Processed datasets, analysis outputs, and supporting documentation are shared with collaborators. Follow-up discussions can be arranged to clarify results, address questions, or plan subsequent experiments.
