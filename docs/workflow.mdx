# How We Support Quantitative Proteomics Projects
<br />

This page outlines the typical stages of a quantitative proteomics project at the Quantitative Proteomics Core, from initial consultation through data interpretation. The workflow highlights key touchpoints across study planning, experimental execution, data processing, and downstream analysis.

## Consultation and study planning

Each project begins with discussion to clarify the biological question, sample type, and experimental constraints. Study design considerations, including controls, replication, and quantitative strategy, are reviewed to ensure feasibility and robustness prior to experimental work.

---

## Sample preparation and experimental execution

Samples are processed using established and optimised workflows appropriate for the study design. Depending on the application, this may include enrichment strategies, fractionation, and high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis.

---

## Data processing and quality control

Raw mass spectrometry data are processed using validated analysis pipelines. Quality control is performed at multiple stages to assess data completeness, reproducibility, and quantitative performance before downstream interpretation.

---

## Data analysis and interpretation

Processed data are evaluated through statistical analysis and visualisation in the context of the original biological question. Results are discussed with collaborators to assess robustness, relevance, and suitability for publication or follow-up studies.

---

## Data delivery and follow-up

Processed datasets, analysis outputs, and supporting documentation are shared with collaborators. Follow-up discussions may be arranged to clarify results, address questions, or plan subsequent experiments.
