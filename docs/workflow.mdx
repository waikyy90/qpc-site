# How We Support Quantitative Proteomics Projects
<br />

Our workflows are designed to support proteomics studies from initial consultation through data interpretation. Each project is discussed and tailored to ensure technical feasibility, appropriate experimental design, and biologically meaningful outcomes.

**Consultation & study planning**

Each project begins with a discussion to clarify the biological question, sample type, and experimental constraints. Study design, controls, replicates, and quantitative strategies are reviewed together to ensure feasibility and robustness before experiments begin.

**Sample preparation & experimental execution**

Samples are processed using established and optimized workflows appropriate for the study design. Depending on the application, this may include enrichment strategies, fractionation, label-free approaches, and high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis.

**Data processing & quality control**

Raw mass spectrometry data are processed using validated analysis pipelines. Quality control is performed at multiple stages to assess data completeness, reproducibility, and quantitative performance.

**Data analysis & interpretation**

We support downstream data analysis through statistical evaluation, visualization, and biological contextualization. Results are discussed with collaborators to ensure findings are interpretable, relevant, and suitable for publication or follow-up studies.

**Data delivery & follow-up**

Processed datasets, analysis outputs, and supporting documentation are shared with collaborators. Follow-up discussions can be arranged to clarify results, address questions, or plan subsequent experiments.
