# For Collaborators
<br />

This page outlines practical guidance for collaborators preparing samples for submission to the Quantitative Proteomics Core (QPC).
The information below is intended to support smooth sample handling, reproducible processing, and timely analysis.

These guidelines typically apply after initial discussion and study planning, as part of the agreed workflow.

If you are unsure whether your samples meet these expectations, early discussion is encouraged.

## Proteome analysis

<details>
<summary>Sample submission for global proteomics</summary>

<div className="qpc-details-intro">
  Typical sample preparation and submission expectations for whole-proteome studies.
</div>

**Typical starting points**

- **Total protein amount:** ~**250 µg** per sample  
- **Recommended concentration:** ~**10 µg/µL**  
  - Lower concentrations down to ~**4 µg/µL** may be acceptable after discussion  
- **Storage:** −80 °C  
- **Protease inhibitors:** do not include  
- **Delivery:** dry ice  

**Lysis considerations**

- Please discuss lysis buffer composition prior to submission (e.g., RIPA, HEPES, urea, SDS)
- Low-input or specialised samples may require adapted workflows

## Interactome analysis

<details>
<summary>Sample submission for IP-MS / pull-downs / BioID / affinity enrichment</summary>

<div className="qpc-details-intro">
  Sample submission formats for interactome studies depend strongly on experimental design and enrichment strategy.
</div>

Specific formats may vary depending on the enrichment approach and biological question.

**Typical submission formats**

- Magnetic beads with bound proteins  
  - Boil beads directly in **25 µL of 2× sample buffer** at **95 °C**  
- Agarose beads with bound proteins  
  - Boil beads directly in **50 µL of 2× sample buffer** at **95 °C**
- Submit samples **after denaturation**  
- **Storage:** −80 °C  
- **Delivery:** on ice if already denatured  

> Alternative submission formats may be acceptable depending on the experiment.

## Sample labelling and organisation

<details>
<summary>Labelling and sample grouping</summary>

<div className="qpc-details-intro">
  Clear labelling and sample organisation are essential for traceability and efficient processing.
</div>

**Tube labelling**

- Label tube lids with:
  - your **initials**
  - a **running sample number**
  - **date of submission**

**Sample grouping**

- Group samples by experimental condition  
- Example:
  - Control: DK1 – DK4  
  - Condition 1: DK5 – DK8  
  - Condition 2: DK9 – DK12  

Additional metadata can be provided using the sample submission form below.

## Turnaround time

<details>
<summary>Typical timelines</summary>

<div className="qpc-details-intro">
  Indicative timelines for proteomics projects once acceptable samples are received.
</div>

- Typical turnaround time is approximately **4 weeks**
- Timelines may vary depending on:
  - sample quality or preparation issues  
  - experimental complexity  
  - extent of optimisation required during execution  
  - instrument availability  
  - data analysis requirements

## Cost recovery and billing

<details>
<summary>Cost recovery and payment matters</summary>

<div className="qpc-details-intro">
  Cost recovery is handled in accordance with institutional guidelines and is intended to cover consumables only. CSI Singapore heavily subsidises instrumental and manpower costs.
</div>

**Institutional billing policy**

- For collaborators affiliated with CSI Singapore, **CSI grant funding is required** in order to access internal cost-recovery rates
- Projects billed to non-CSI grants (e.g. NUS or external accounts) will be charged at non-CSI rates

**Cost recovery timing**

- Cost recovery for consumables is typically initiated **after the first round of processed, analysed, and visualised data has been shared**
- This allows collaborators to review initial results prior to billing

If you have questions regarding billing or account eligibility, please contact us early so that arrangements can be clarified in advance.

## Communication and follow-up

<details>
<summary>Working together</summary>

<div className="qpc-details-intro">
  Open communication helps align expectations and supports effective collaboration.
</div>

- Early discussion is encouraged to assess feasibility and study design  
- Questions regarding sample preparation or submission format are welcome  
- Follow-up discussions can be arranged to clarify results or plan next steps
