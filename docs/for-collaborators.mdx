# For Collaborators
<br />

This page provides practical guidance for collaborators preparing samples for submission to the Quantitative Proteomics Core (QPC).

The information below applies after initial discussion and study planning, as part of the agreed workflow.

---

## Proteome analysis

<details>
<summary>Sample submission for global proteomics</summary>

<div className="qpc-details-intro">
  Typical starting points for whole-proteome studies.
</div>

**Starting points**

- **Total protein amount:** ~**250 µg** per sample  
- **Recommended concentration:** ~**10 µg/µL**  
  - Lower concentrations (down to ~**4 µg/µL**) may be acceptable after discussion  
- **Storage:** −80 °C  
- **Protease inhibitors:** do not include  
- **Delivery:** dry ice  

**Lysis considerations**

- Discuss lysis buffer composition prior to submission (e.g. RIPA, HEPES, urea, SDS)
- Low-input or specialised samples may require adapted workflows

## Interactome analysis

<details>
<summary>Sample submission for IP-MS / pull-downs / BioID / affinity enrichment</summary>

<div className="qpc-details-intro">
  Submission formats depend on experimental design and enrichment strategy.
</div>

**Typical submission formats**

- Magnetic beads with bound proteins  
  - Boil beads in **25 µL of 2× sample buffer** at **95 °C**  
- Agarose beads with bound proteins  
  - Boil beads in **50 µL of 2× sample buffer** at **95 °C**
- Submit samples **after denaturation**  
- **Storage:** −80 °C  
- **Delivery:** on ice if already denatured  

> Alternative submission formats may be acceptable depending on the experiment.

## Sample labelling and organisation

<details>
<summary>Labelling and sample grouping</summary>

<div className="qpc-details-intro">
  Clear labelling and organisation support traceability and efficient processing.
</div>

**Tube labelling**

- Label tube lids with:
  - **initials**
  - **running sample number**
  - **date of submission**

**Sample grouping**

- Group samples by experimental condition  
- Example:
  - Control: DK1 – DK4  
  - Condition 1: DK5 – DK8  
  - Condition 2: DK9 – DK12  

Additional metadata can be provided using the sample submission form below.

## Turnaround time

<details>
<summary>Typical timelines</summary>

<div className="qpc-details-intro">
  Indicative timelines once acceptable samples are received.
</div>

- Typical turnaround time: **~4 weeks**
- Timelines may vary with:
  - sample quality or preparation issues  
  - experimental complexity  
  - optimisation requirements  
  - instrument availability  
  - data analysis needs

## Cost recovery and billing

<details>
<summary>Cost recovery and payment matters</summary>

<div className="qpc-details-intro">
  Cost recovery follows institutional guidelines and covers consumables only. CSI Singapore subsidises instrumental and manpower costs for academic research.
</div>

**Institutional billing policy**

- CSI-affiliated collaborators must use **CSI grant funding** to access internal cost-recovery rates  
- Projects billed to non-CSI grants (e.g. NUS or external accounts) are charged at non-CSI rates  

**Cost recovery timing**

- Consumable cost recovery is initiated **after the first round of processed, analysed, and visualised data is shared**

</details>

## Communication and follow-up

<details>
<summary>Working together</summary>

<div className="qpc-details-intro">
  Open communication supports effective collaboration.
</div>

- Early discussion to assess feasibility and study design  
- Questions on sample preparation or submission format  
- Follow-up discussions to clarify results or plan next steps  

</details>
