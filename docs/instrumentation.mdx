# Our Platforms and Instruments
<br />

Our instrumentation supports quantitative proteomics workflows across discovery, interaction, and spatial analyses. Platforms are selected based on study design, sample type, and analytical requirements.

## Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS)

High-resolution LC–MS systems are operated for quantitative proteomics and interaction studies, supporting both discovery-oriented and targeted applications. Method selection and instrument configuration are tailored to study design and sample constraints.

- **Bruker timsTOF fleX mass spectrometer**  
- **Thermo Fisher Scientific Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer**  
- **Evosep One liquid chromatography system**

## Imaging mass spectrometry

Imaging mass spectrometry platform supports spatially resolved analyses and tissue-based studies where localisation is part of the biological question.

- **Bruker timsTOF fleX MALDI**

---

## Sample processing

Front-end sample processing instrumentation supports reproducible preparation of biological samples prior to mass spectrometry analysis.

- **Bruker BeatBox tissue homogenizer**
