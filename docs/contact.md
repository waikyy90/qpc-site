## Getting started with a project

If you are considering a proteomics study or would like to explore whether a particular approach is suitable, we encourage early discussion. Initial conversations help clarify feasibility, align expectations, and identify the most appropriate experimental strategy.

You do not need a fully developed plan to reach out — exploratory discussions are welcome.

## What information is helpful to include

To help us understand your project context, it is useful (but not mandatory) to share:

- The **biological question** or hypothesis you are interested in  
- The **experimental system** (e.g. cell lines, tissues, clinical samples)  
- Any **perturbations or comparisons** involved (e.g. treatment, knockdown, conditions)  
- Approximate **sample numbers** and availability  
- Whether the study is **exploratory, hypothesis-driven, or translational**  
- Any **timeline considerations** or downstream goals (e.g. publication, pilot data)

Even brief descriptions are sufficient for an initial discussion.

## What happens after you contact us

Following your enquiry, we typically arrange a discussion to:

- Clarify the scientific objectives  
- Assess technical feasibility and study design considerations  
- Discuss suitable proteomics strategies and workflows  
- Identify potential pilot or optimisation steps, if needed  

These discussions help ensure that experiments are well aligned with the biological question and that generated data are robust and interpretable.

## Collaboration and support

We work closely with collaborators throughout the course of a study, from experimental planning through data interpretation. Our role extends beyond data generation to include discussion of results and support for downstream analysis and reporting.

If you are unsure whether proteomics is appropriate for your question, we are happy to discuss this as part of an initial conversation.
