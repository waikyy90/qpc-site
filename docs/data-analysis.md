# How We Approach Proteomics Data Analysis
<br />

Data analysis is treated as an extension of experimental design rather than a downstream step. Our approach focuses on understanding what a dataset can reliably support, how confidently results can be interpreted, and where analytical limits lie.

Analysis strategies are adapted to the biological question, study design, and data quality, with emphasis on minimising bias and avoiding over-interpretation.

## Understanding the dataset before interpretation

Before examining biological differences, we assess whether the dataset behaves as expected from an experimental and technical perspective. This includes reviewing experimental setup and controls, replicate structure, and descriptive statistics such as proteome depth, data completeness, and missing value patterns.

Known controls or expected targets, where available, are used as internal benchmarks to confirm that the experimental design is reflected in the data.

## Quantitative reasoning and statistical context

Quantitative analysis is guided by both statistical considerations and biological context. We examine data distributions, effect sizes, consistency across replicates, and depth of coverage, rather than prioritising significance alone.

Statistical results are interpreted in relation to the experimental question. In some cases, statistically significant changes may be biologically weak, while consistent trends may warrant discussion despite limited statistical power. These distinctions are discussed explicitly with collaborators.

## Quality control across the workflow

Quality control is considered throughout the workflow, from experimental design and sample preparation to data processing and analysis. This includes evaluating control adequacy, replicate concordance, and the appropriateness of applied thresholds and filtering steps.

Unexpected global changes or excessive variability are treated as analytical red flags rather than positive findings. In such cases, we discuss whether conclusions should be limited, whether redesign or additional replication is required, or whether results should be interpreted conservatively.

## Interpretation through collaboration

Data interpretation is conducted as a dialogue rather than one-way delivery. We work with collaborators to explain what the data show, how much confidence can be placed in specific observations, and what the data cannot support.

Where appropriate, downstream analyses such as functional enrichment are used to contextualise findings, provided they align with the biological question and dataset structure.

## Data delivery and reproducibility

Processed datasets, quality metrics, and analysis outputs are delivered in a clear and traceable manner. Key analysis decisions and parameters are documented to support reproducibility, follow-up analyses, and manuscript preparation.

Our aim is to provide results that are technically sound, interpretable, and defensible for downstream biological reasoning.
