# How We Support Data Analysis
<br />

Data analysis is an integral part of our proteomics workflows. We support collaborators in transforming raw mass spectrometry data into interpretable, biologically meaningful results aligned with the goals of each study.

**Data processing and quantification**

Raw mass spectrometry data are processed using established and validated analysis pipelines appropriate for the experimental design. Quantification strategies are selected based on the study type, data acquisition method, and analytical requirements.

**Quality control and assessment**

Quality control is performed at multiple stages of data processing to assess data completeness, reproducibility, and quantitative performance. These checks help ensure that results are robust and suitable for downstream analysis and interpretation.

**Statistical analysis and visualization**

We support statistical analysis and data visualization to aid interpretation of proteomics results. This includes comparative analyses, summary metrics, and visual representations that facilitate biological insight and communication of findings.

**Biological interpretation and reporting**

Results are discussed with collaborators to place findings in biological context and to support hypothesis generation or validation. Analysis outputs and documentation are prepared to support publications, presentations, or further experimental work.

**Data delivery and documentation**

Processed datasets, analysis results, and supporting documentation are shared with collaborators in appropriate formats. Data delivery is designed to be clear, reproducible, and compatible with downstream analysis or long-term storage.
