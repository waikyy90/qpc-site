# Start a collaboration
<br />

We encourage early discussion — even at the idea or pilot stage — to assess feasibility and design a robust quantitative proteomics study around real biological and practical constraints.

You do not need a fully defined workflow to start a conversation.

## When to contact QPC

Early engagement is helpful if:

- You are planning a proteomics study and want to confirm feasibility or study design  
- Sample amount is limited, precious, or difficult to reproduce  
- You are unsure which proteomics approach is appropriate  
- You would like input on controls, replication, or quantitative strategy  
- You have preliminary or pilot data and want to assess supported conclusions

<details>
<summary>What to share for a first discussion</summary>

A short message is sufficient.

**Scientific context**
- Biological question or hypothesis (1–2 sentences)
- System and sample type

**Study design (if available)**
- Conditions to compare
- Approximate number of samples

**Practical considerations**
- Expected sample amount or material constraints
- Buffer, reagent, or processing constraints

<details>
<summary>What to expect after reaching out</summary>

After an initial discussion, we typically:

- Clarify the biological objective and analytical scope  
- Recommend a quantitative strategy and key design considerations  
- Discuss sample preparation and handling requirements  
- Align on timelines and useful deliverables  

Discussion may continue as data becomes available.

<summary>What collaborators typically receive</summary>

Depending on study design and scope, QPC support may include:

- Quality-controlled, analysed datasets aligned to the biological question  
- Publication-ready figures and summary visualisations  
- Processed outputs with secure storage of raw mass spectrometry data  
- Follow-up discussions to interpret results and assess robustness  
- Iterative support for downstream questions or follow-up experiments  
- Input on proteomics-related aspects of manuscripts, where appropriate  

The form and depth of support are discussed upfront and may evolve during the project.
