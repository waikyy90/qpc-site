# Our Approach to Proteomics Collaboration
<br />

We work as collaborative research partners, helping researchers translate biological questions into robust, publication-ready quantitative proteomics studies.

## What this means in practice

<details>
<summary>Early discussion and study planning</summary>

Each project begins with discussion to clarify the biological question, study objectives, and technical feasibility. Early engagement helps align expectations and ensures that experimental strategies are appropriate for the system under study before data generation begins.

</details>

<details>
<summary>From biological question to experimental strategy</summary>

Biological questions are translated into suitable proteomics approaches through joint planning. We advise on experimental design, controls, sample types, and quantitative strategies, and discuss pilot or optimisation steps where appropriate prior to larger-scale studies.

</details>

<details>
<summary>From results to biological understanding</summary>

Support extends beyond data generation to include review and discussion of results in biological context. Findings are examined together to assess robustness, interpretability, and relevance to the original research question.
