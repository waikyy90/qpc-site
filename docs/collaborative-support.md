# Our Approach to Proteomics Collaboration
<br />
We believe robust proteomics data is best achieved through thoughtful experimental planning, careful execution, and close collaboration throughout a study.

**How we work with collaborators**

Each project begins with discussion and alignment on the biological question, study objectives, and technical feasibility to ensure robust, interpretable outcomes. Through this approach, we operate as a collaborative research partner rather than a service facility.

**From question to experiment**

Biological questions are translated into appropriate proteomics strategies through joint planning. We advise on experimental design, controls, sample types, and quantitative approaches, and discuss pilot or optimization steps where appropriate before larger studies proceed.

**From data to insight**

Support extends beyond data acquisition to include data processing, quality assessment, and interpretation. Results are reviewed together with collaborators to ensure analytical soundness and biological relevance.

**What collaborators can expect**

- Guidance on experimental design and workflow selection  
- Access to quantitative proteomics and mass spectrometry platforms  
- Processed, quality-controlled datasets  
- Clear documentation of methods and analysis parameters  
- Support with data interpretation and discussion  
- Input on proteomics aspects of manuscripts and reporting
