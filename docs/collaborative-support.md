# Our Approach to Proteomics Collaboration
<br />

We believe robust proteomics studies are best achieved through careful experimental thinking and close collaboration throughout a project. Our role is to work alongside researchers to design, execute, and interpret studies in a way that supports meaningful and defensible biological conclusions.

## How we work with collaborators

Each project begins with discussion and alignment on the biological question, study objectives, and technical feasibility. This early engagement helps ensure that experimental strategies are appropriate for the system under study and that expectations are aligned before data generation begins.

Through this process, we operate as a collaborative research partner rather than a transactional service.

## From biological question to experimental strategy

Biological questions are translated into suitable proteomics approaches through joint planning. We advise on experimental design, controls, sample types, and quantitative strategies, and discuss pilot or optimisation steps where appropriate prior to larger-scale studies.

This stage focuses on ensuring that the experimental design can support the intended biological interpretation.

## From results to understanding

Support extends beyond data generation to include review and discussion of results in biological context. Findings are examined together with collaborators to assess robustness, interpretability, and relevance to the original research question.
